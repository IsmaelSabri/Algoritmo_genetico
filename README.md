The algorithm receives as arguments an initial population and the configuration parameters where after the execution of all the generations, it shows the best one. Each single is represented as a chromosome with its genotype, a phenotype, and a fitness function. Chromosomes are bounded by three attributes: upper and lower bounds and the representation tolerance.
